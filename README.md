# Socket++
C++ Socket interface for Linux, Windows and Mac.

Goal: Fast reliable easy-to-use lightweight multi-platform pure C++ socket interface for TCP and UDP.

I'm creating this for using in all my C++ projects that involves networking, including geolocation and multiplayer games, so you can rest assured this repo will be keept clean and updated(after complete, of course). :3

Completed:
 - Linux TCP (blocking/non-blocking)

Ongoing:
 - Linux UDP (blocking/non-blocking)

To Do:
 - Windows TCP (blocking/non-blocking)
 - Windows UDP (blocking/non-blocking)
 - Mac TCP (blocking/non-blocking)
 - Mac UDP (blocking/non-blocking)

Note: You will need to use the flag -std=c++11 to compile the examples when using g++.

Have fun!
